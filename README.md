# Department-of-DRAGONS
Game developed during Java tutorials for growingSTEMS

# Requirements
You need Android Studio and Git installed to build and run this.
These are the same programs we use at robotics so you'll need them anyways if you want to write code for the team.

Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/

Git: https://git-scm.com/download/

# Downloading
If you get errors about not having Git, and you're sure you have Git installed, restart your computer.

1. Open Android Studio. On the Welcome screen, click "Check out project from Version Control" > "Git"
2. Change "Directory" to whatever folder you want it to download to.
3. In the URL, put this for the normal game:
`git@github.com:codydg/Department-of-DRAGONS.git`
4. (alternative to 3) If you would like the testing edition, put this as the url:
`git@github.com:rgbond13/Department-of-DRAGONS.git`
 
5. Click Clone. When it's done, it'll ask if you want to open the project. Click Yes.

Upon opening, it may report an error saying "Unsupported Modules Detected". This is perfectly fine.
Also, if you want to use testing features, open Git Bash and type `git checkout testing`. You can also type `git switch testing`

# Running
1. Near the top-center of your screen, click "Add Configuration"
2. Click the '+' in the top-left, and choose "Application"
3. Provide a name (eg "Department of Dragons")
4. Next to "Main class:" put `com.example.consoleprogram.ConsoleProgram`.
5. Next to "Use classpath of module", click the drop-down and choose "ConsoleProgram".
6. Click "OK" at the bottom.
7. To run, click the green play button at the top of your screen, or press Shift+F10.
The 'Run' menu (tab located at bottom of screen) should open up, and not too long later the game should start.
You can stop with the red stop button, or Ctrl+F2.
 an example issue you can use for reference.
